<h2 align="left">Styling and Layout</h2>
<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a cornerstone technology used to style and layout web pages. It allows developers to apply styles to HTML elements, such as setting colors, fonts, and spacing. CSS enables the separation of content from design, which means that the structure and content of a webpage can remain consistent while its appearance can be customized across different pages. By controlling the layout, CSS makes it possible to create visually appealing and user-friendly web pages, improving the overall user experience.</p>
<h2 align="left">Responsiveness and Media Queries</h2>
<p>One of the key features of CSS is its ability to make web pages responsive. With the use of media queries, CSS can adapt the layout of a web page to different screen sizes and devices, such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This ensures that web content is easily accessible and readable on any device. Media queries allow developers to apply specific styles based on the device's characteristics, such as its width, height, orientation, and resolution, making websites flexible and adaptive</p>
<h2 align="left">Animation and Visual Effects</h2>
<p>CSS also provides powerful tools for creating animations and visual effects. Through properties like transitions, transforms, and animations, developers can add dynamic elements to their web pages, enhancing interactivity and user engagement. CSS animations can be used to create effects such as fading, sliding, and rotating elements, which can make a website more lively and interesting. These capabilities not only improve the aesthetic appeal of a website but also help in guiding user interactions and drawing attention to important elements.</p>
